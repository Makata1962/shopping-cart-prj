## Technologies Used

In this "Shopping Cart" project, several modern web development technologies and libraries have been utilized to ensure a robust, efficient, and user-friendly application. Here are some of the key technologies used:

### React Query

- **Server-Side State Management**: React Query is used for managing server-side state. It provides powerful features like automatic caching, background updates, and data synchronization without the need to update the global state.

### Tailwind CSS

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS is employed for styling the application. Its utility-first approach allows for rapid UI development with more control over the design and responsiveness.

### Redux Toolkit

- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit is used for efficient global state management. It simplifies the configuration of the Redux store and provides useful utilities for creating reducers and actions.

### Styled Components

- **Custom Spinners**: Styled Components are used to create custom spinners. This demonstrates my knowledge in building dynamic UI elements with encapsulated styling.

### Ant Design (AntD)

- **UI Components**: Ant Design is a React UI library that has been used for its high-quality components and extensive documentation. It provides a comprehensive set of design tools and components that are highly customizable.

### Toast

- **Notifications**: Toast is used for notifications within the application. It provides a simple and effective way to display messages to the user, enhancing the interactivity and user experience.

These technologies were chosen for their efficiency, ease of use, and community support. They contribute significantly to the project's scalability, maintainability, and overall performance.
